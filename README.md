# Sales-EDA-Preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data preprocessing on retail sales dataset including missing value treatment, IQR-based outlier detection, feature encoding, correlation analysis, and data visualization using Python.


##  Project Overview
This project performs comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data preprocessing on a retail sales dataset. The objective is to clean, analyze, and prepare the data for regression modeling.

 Key Tasks Performed-
## Data Cleaning

Missing value imputation (mean/median), Categorical value handling, Feature selection

## Feature Engineering

One-hot encoding for categorical variables, Train-test split

## Outlier Detection

IQR (Interquartile Range) method, Median replacement for extreme values

## Summary Statistics

Descriptive statistics (describe()), Correlation matrix analysis

## EDA Visualizations

Sales distribution (Histogram + KDE), Sales outlier detection (Boxplot), Correlation heatmap

## Data Scaling

StandardScaler, Normalization

## Technologies Used

Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

## Outcome

Cleaned and preprocessed dataset ready for regression modeling and predictive analytics.
