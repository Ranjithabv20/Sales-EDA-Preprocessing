# Sales-EDA-Preprocessing
Sales EDA &amp; preprocessing pipeline for machine learning using Python, including outlier treatment, encoding, scaling, and correlation analysis.

- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand sales patterns and key influencing factors.
- Selected relevant features impacting sales performance.
- Handled missing values to ensure data completeness and reliability.
- Converted categorical variables into numerical format for machine learning compatibility.
- Detected and treated outliers using statistical methods to improve data quality.
- Analyzed feature relationships using correlation analysis.
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets for proper model evaluation.
- Applied feature scaling to ensure balanced input for machine learning algorithms.
- Prepared a clean and structured dataset ready for sales prediction models.
