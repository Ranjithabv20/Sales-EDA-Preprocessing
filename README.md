# 📊 Sales Data EDA & Preprocessing

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs exploratory data analysis and preprocessing on sales data to prepare it for machine learning models.

##  Dataset Used
- Source: sales.csv  
- Key Columns:
  - QUANTITYORDERED
  - PRICEEACH
  - STATUS
  - PRODUCTLINE
  - DEALSIZE
  - SALES (Target Variable)

##  Steps Performed
- Loaded and cleaned the dataset
- Handled missing values
- Applied one-hot encoding to categorical variables
- Detected and treated outliers using IQR method
- Performed correlation analysis
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Applied feature scaling and normalization

##  Outcome
Prepared a clean, structured, and model-ready dataset for sales prediction using machine learning algorithms.


- Applied feature scaling to ensure balanced input for machine learning algorithms.
- Prepared a clean and structured dataset ready for sales prediction models.
